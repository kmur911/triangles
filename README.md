# Requirements: python3

To run it simply run triangles.py using python3 ('python3 triangles.py' in Ubuntu 14.04)

Once running the on screen prompts should guide you through the possibilities, but essentially you can add two triangles
by their side lengths, and then do analysis on each individual one and comparisons between the two. Invalid entries
will raise errors.
